                 <li> <strong>Sugar Loaf</strong></li>

                 <p> These are the mountains that are most known in New England and have the biggest verticle and width. There are some other great smaller mountais like Waterville Vally and Gunstock that I have been to that are very great as well but there are very close margins.  </p>
            <h1> My personal favorites</h1>
                <ul>
                <li> My Personal favoite mountain that I've been to is <strong>Sunday River</strong>. It has had some flooding problems this year so it had to drop down on the list but it is my personal favorite. it isn't the tallest verticle wise but I just love how it has five peaks and night skiing. There is plenty of space to spread out of it's crowded so it's never to bad. From The North Peak to the Jordan bowl there are runs for everyone. There is challenges for more advanced skiiers and a great deal of beginner runs. Oz is the best peak for advanced skiiers while the runs off the <em> Chondala</em> which is the main lift are great for beginners. It's a great mounatain overall. </li> <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcR6r8rMFR9pcRX0KDspvV16VDve9YZ2ZZkZkQ&usqp=CAU" alt="image of sunday river" width="400"> <p>This image is from @sundayriver on intsagram</p>
                <li>My second favorite is<strong>  Cannon</strong>. I think this is partly because it's the mountain that really made me start to love skiing but it is also exellent. Value wise it's great with a full day adult ticket being $96. It is also never to crowded and there is a great resort called mittersill right next to it. There are plety of runs for people at different levels but the runs at cannon are long and fun.  </li> <img src="https://www.cannonmt.com/assets/images/photolibrary/_1200x630_crop_center-center_none/CannonHeli3-18_002_190210_151017.jpg" width="400" alt="image of cannon mountain">
                <li>My third favorite mountain is <strong>sugar bush </strong> mountain. It's been a very long time since iv'e been there but it's a exellent mountain. I leared to ski here and at mount snow. Sugarbush has a great amount of snow and it's a very large mountain. The lifts are very efficient and it's exellent. </li>
